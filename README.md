# i24 Technical Test

This technical test imitates a Google search page with both web and images results.

Please bear in mind due free Google Search API limitations, the test has some restrictions. Pagination has been limited to 10
as it is the maximun records per query allowed. For the same reason the total amount of results are limited to 100.

Also, the limit of queries a day is 100 so at some point the endpoint will no longer send the expected results for 24 hours.

## Summary


### Prerequisities
